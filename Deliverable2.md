# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here.


## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Teacher Course Planning Tool

**Sprint Number:** 2

**Scrum Master**: Andrew Rath

**Git Master**: Lucas Winesburg

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Your Sprint goal
- Finish user stories that make the program much more usable on a basic level. 

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  12

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
- 6  
  
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

- We feel like just for now this is manageable given our shorthandedness.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

- These user stories will make the program better and easier to navigate for the user. 

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

- Yes, we need to pick up our pace and progress/communicate more consistently and effectively. 



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2, and Continuous Integration starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did NOT attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough, Sprint 3) | GitHub Actions info (does the master pass, Sprint 4) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
|11/6/2024|Miguel|Sprint 2 planning|   |  |  |
|11/8/2024|Olivier, Miguel|Each person picked a task to do|   |   |Stand-up meeting|
|11/12/2024|Miguel|Assigned a task to each member|   |   |Stand-up meeting|
|11/13/2024|Olivier, Miguel|Check in on progress|   |   |Stand-up meeting|
|11/15/2024|Miguel|Discuss and plan UI|   |   |Stand-up meeting|
|11/19/2024|Miguel|Finish Sprint 2|   |   |Sprint Review and Retrospective|

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/ZINtnhBMi7Q

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> Minor but critical bug fixes

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> We did not, as we did not finish all the user stories, and fell short of finishing the UIs

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We were unable to finish any significant user stories. 


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> We did as the user stories we completed fixed several critical bugs in memoranda including the closing error, and the minimize error. 

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No, we did not complete very many of the user stories on the Taiga scrumboard. 

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Improper workload, and miscommunication between group members. 

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> No, we started slow, had a large burst of speed in the middle of the sprint, then slowed down again at the end of the sprint. 

**Did you deliver business value?**

> No, we only did minor fixes that are not very noticeable

**Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g. move Tasks correctly?, keep the Taiga board up to date? work consistently?)**

> We did move tasks correctly and mostly kept the Taiga board up to date. We did not work consistently. 

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint? (not needed for last Sprint)**

> Work more consistently, and get all group members working on it. 

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Anxious and worried, as we are not making very much progress. 

**Starting in Sprint 2**
Include a screenshot of your Burndown chart here and analyse in detail for me why it looks the way it does and how you could improve it if it needs improving. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c10a91ae-1caf-46e8-ab65-cb829422f672)

> It looks the way it does because we did not close any pull requests during the sprint, and only got a few User Stories into ready for test. 

### Contributions (all sprints):

> In this section I want you to point me to your main contributions (each of you individually) for the current Sprint. Some of the below you will only need starting in later Sprints, I marked when they become important. 

Copy the section for each team member and then everyone adds their individual contributions. 

#### Team member Andrew Rath

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 
I did not work consistently, as I was working heavily on my other class, and when I finished my work in that class, I had one day where I finished one user story (fixing the language) and another task in another user story. Meanwhile, every other day was very slow for me.

I put enough work on this sprint but the only problem I didn't fix any bug or finished any task but as we work on team I feel better compare to the last 
sprint 1, hope doing more in thix next sprint.

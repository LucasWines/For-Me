## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Teacher Course Planning Tool

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**: Lucas Winesburg

**Git Master**: Andrew Rath

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** To understand the main features of Memoranda, and to fix obvious bugs

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  13

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 10
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> They are reasonable to accomplish, and provide a good basis to understand Memoranda. 

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> Many of them are about fixing major problems, and documenting the structure of the program. 

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> yes



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2, and Continuous Integration starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did NOT attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough, Sprint 3) | GitHub Actions info (does the master pass, Sprint 4) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: [https://youtu.be/7EIs9rBzjRM](https://youtu.be/7EIs9rBzjRM)

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

Andrew: Most of my value was in the documentation and Diagram creation. Helping to facilitate communication through slack as well.
Lucas: I tried to help get into the user stories and document as much of our meetings as needed to have everyone prepared for our next meeting. 

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

Andrew: I do not feel like I worked enough, trying to balance my course load. 
Lucas: I feel like I did work enough but I do not feel like I got the amount done that was expected of me. 

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

No, we could have done more in the back log to complete user stories. This will be our focus moving forward now that we know what are working with and can adapt to it. 


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

No, we did not fully complete any user stories. 

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

No, we did not. Communication and meeting availability has been a crippling issue for our group.

**If not, what went wrong?**

We have not been able to all meet up together consistently. During that time we also have not had a constant stream of communication at all. We are still trying to correct this through Slack. 

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

We moved slow to start and have been trying to play catch-up for the final few days of our sprint. 

**Did you deliver business value?**

No, we did not. The only problem we fixed was the closing error (still in testing) and creating the large amount of diagrams for packages (but these are more for the developer side).

**Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g. move Tasks correctly?, keep the Taiga board up to date? work consistently?)**

Yes, technically we did. We did not do quite enough as a group to correctly measure this but so far all has been done correctly. 

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint? (not needed for last Sprint)**

Yes, we can communicate more effectively in order to meet together at a more consistent rate. We also can begin and complete tasks much quicker. 

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

We feel anxious over the amount of work and the lack of communication and meeting as a full group. These are problems that will be addressed and can be fixed. 

**Starting in Sprint 2**
Include a screenshot of your Burndown chart here and analyse in detail for me why it looks the way it does and how you could improve it if it needs improving.

### Contributions (all sprints):

> In this section I want you to point me to your main contributions (each of you individually) for the current Sprint. Some of the below you will only need starting in later Sprints, I marked when they become important. 

Copy the section for each team member and then everyone adds their individual contributions. 

#### Team member Andrew Rath -- replace <A> with your name:

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 
I did not, as I had a lot of work in both this class and my other class, and did not budget enough time to consistently put work into the project. I also chose to work on the documentation first, which did not provide a lot of deliverables to commit. 

   #### Team member Thuan Nguyen -- replace <A> with your name: 

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 

- Yes, I do. We had a full group meeting and discussed together to understand better what is worth doing and what will be done in the future. 

   #### Team member Lucas Winesburg: 

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer).
  - No I don't think I did quite enough for this since we are fairly short handed but I did work consistently. I think I will need to heavily pick up my pace of work for the remaining sprints.

  #### Team member Olivier Busuguru-- replace <A> with your name:
  

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 

Honestly I didn't put enough work because I was struggling to understand the  material in general I hope to go ahead and contribute enough in this next sprint 2
